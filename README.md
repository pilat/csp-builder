## 📋 About Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a critical security standard that helps prevent various types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. CSP works by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load based on the source of those resources.

However, creating effective CSP headers can be challenging:
- Syntax is complex and unforgiving
- Different directives serve different security purposes
- Balancing security with website functionality is difficult

CSP Builder makes this process accessible to developers of all experience levels.
